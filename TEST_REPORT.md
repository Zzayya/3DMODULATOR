## Critical Issues
1. CRITICAL: Cookie cutter tab tries to create duplicate #canvasContainer

## Warnings
1. Cookie cutter tab has comment "Shares same canvas" but both tabs try to use #canvasContainer
2. Tab switching may not properly clear/restore the mesh
3. FileReader API required - may not work in very old browsers
4. Cookie cutter uses basic createWatertightMesh - not true cookie cutter geometry with thin blade walls

## Notes
1. Flood fill uses iterative approach (good for avoiding stack overflow)
2. Uses ES6 syntax (requires modern browser or transpilation)
