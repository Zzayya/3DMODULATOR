## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix)

### 1. Cookie Cutter Tab - No Canvas Display
**Location:** Line 650-652
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Feature is broken
**Description:** The Cookie Cutter tab has an empty viewer-container with only a comment "Shares same canvas". There's no actual canvas element for the 3D viewer.

**Impact:** When users switch to the Cookie Cutter tab and generate a cookie cutter, they won't see any 3D visualization because there's no canvas to render to.

**Current Code:**
```html
<div class="viewer-container">
    <!-- Shares same canvas -->
</div>
```

**The Problem:**
- The STL Generator tab has `<div id="canvasContainer"></div>` (line 511)
- The Cookie Cutter tab is empty
- Both tabs need to share the same Three.js scene/canvas OR each needs its own

**Possible Solutions:**
1. Move the canvas outside both tabs so it's shared
2. Add logic to move the canvas between tabs when switching
3. Create separate canvases for each tab
4. Duplicate the viewer controls and status in the cookie cutter tab

## ⚠️ WARNINGS (Should Fix)

### 2. Tab Switching - Mesh Persistence
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Description:** When switching between tabs, the current mesh stays in the scene. If you generate a model in one tab, then switch to another tab and generate a different model, the viewer might show confusing results.

**Recommended Fix:** Add mesh clearing logic to tab switch event handlers

---

### 3. Cookie Cutter Geometry - Not Authentic
**Severity:** LOW (Feature incomplete)
**Description:** The cookie cutter generator currently just creates a basic extruded shape using `createWatertightMesh()`. Real cookie cutters have:
- Thin blade walls (not solid shapes)
- A base/handle separate from the blade
- Hollow interior

**Current Behavior:** Creates a solid 3D shape (same as STL generator)

**Note:** This is more of an incomplete feature than a bug

---

### 4. Browser Compatibility
**Severity:** LOW
**Description:** The app uses modern JavaScript features:
- ES6 modules (`import`)
- FileReader API
- Typed Arrays (Uint8Array)
- const/let declarations

**Impact:** Won't work in Internet Explorer or very old browsers

**Note:** This is acceptable for a modern web app

## 📝 POSITIVE NOTES

### What's Working Well:
1. ✅ Flood fill algorithm uses iterative approach (prevents stack overflow)
2. ✅ Proper memory cleanup with geometry.dispose() and material.dispose()
3. ✅ Null checks before using currentMesh
4. ✅ All required DOM elements are present
5. ✅ Three.js integration is properly set up
6. ✅ Complete image processing pipeline (Gaussian blur, Otsu threshold, morphological operations)
7. ✅ STL export properly formatted with normals
8. ✅ Event listeners properly attached
9. ✅ Responsive design with media queries

## 🎯 PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS

**Must Fix Before Release:**
1. Fix cookie cutter canvas display (#1)

**Should Fix Soon:**
2. Add tab switching logic to handle mesh state (#2)

**Nice to Have:**
3. Implement proper cookie cutter geometry (#3)

**Can Ignore:**
4. Browser compatibility warning (#4) - modern browsers are fine
