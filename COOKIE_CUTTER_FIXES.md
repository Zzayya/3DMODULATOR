# Cookie Cutter Fixes - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Canvas Sharing Between Tabs (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem:** Cookie Cutter tab had no canvas for 3D visualization

**Solution:**
- Restructured HTML to move the 3D viewer outside both tabs
- Both STL Generator and Cookie Cutter tabs now share the same canvas
- Canvas is always visible and updates when switching between tabs

**Changes:**
- Moved `<div class="viewer-container">` outside `tab-content` divs
- Made it a shared component for both tabs
- Updated layout to `main-grid` contains both tabs + shared viewer

### 2. Proper Cookie Cutter Geometry Implementation
**Problem:** Cookie cutter was using `createWatertightMesh()` which creates solid shapes, ignoring all cookie cutter parameters

**Solution:** Created new `createCookieCutterMesh()` function that properly implements:

#### Features:
- **Thin Blade Walls**: Uses contour offsetting to create hollow interior
  - Outer shape: The cutting edge outline
  - Inner shape: Offset inward by `bladeThick` parameter
  - Creates proper hollow cookie cutter structure

- **Adjustable Blade Height**: Uses `bladeHeight` parameter for blade extrusion

- **Base/Handle Support**:
  - Optional base (toggle via checkbox)
  - Base extends beyond blade by `baseExt` parameter
  - Base thickness controlled by `baseThick` parameter
  - Base rendered in different color (purple) for visual distinction

- **All Parameters Now Functional**:
  - ✅ Blade Thickness (0.5-5mm)
  - ✅ Blade Height (5-50mm)
  - ✅ Base Thickness (1-10mm)
  - ✅ Base Extension (0-30mm)
  - ✅ Overall Size (30-150mm)
  - ✅ Include Base checkbox

### 3. Enhanced Memory Management
**Problem:** `clearMesh()` only handled single meshes

**Solution:**
- Updated to handle both single meshes and THREE.Group objects
- Properly disposes geometry and materials for all children
- Prevents memory leaks when switching between models

---

### 4. Enhanced STL Export
**Problem:** `exportSTL()` couldn't export groups (cookie cutter has blade + base)

**Solution:**
- Updated to handle both single meshes and groups
- Applies world matrix transformations correctly
- Exports all parts of cookie cutter as single STL file

## 🎨 How Cookie Cutter Works Now

### Workflow:
1. **Upload Image** → Drag/drop or click to upload shape image
2. **Adjust Settings** → Use sliders to customize dimensions
3. **Generate** → Click "Generate Cookie Cutter"
   - Detects outline of subject in image
   - Applies Gaussian blur and morphological operations
   - Creates thin blade walls following outline
   - Adds base/handle if enabled
4. **Preview** → View 3D model with rotation controls
5. **Export** → Download as STL file for 3D printing

### Visual Feedback:
- Blade walls: Blue/purple gradient
- Base/handle: Purple (when enabled)
- Real-time measurements displayed
- Status updates during generation

## 🔧 Technical Details

### New Functions Added:
1. `createCookieCutterMesh(points, params, scale)`
   - Main cookie cutter geometry generator
   - Creates thin-walled blade structure
   - Adds optional base/handle

2. `offsetContour(points, offset)`
   - Offsets contour inward for creating hollow interior
   - Simplified centroid-based approach
   - Filters degenerate points

### Updated Functions:
1. `clearMesh()` - Now handles THREE.Group
2. `exportSTL()` - Now exports multi-part models
3. Cookie cutter generation event handler - Uses new function with all parameters
